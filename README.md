## Guides (how to run webserver)
- in terminal (wsl/colima) Goto repo root directory

  ```
  cd to/your/web_server_docker
  ```

- Build docker images

  ```
  docker compose -f docker-compose.build.yml build
  ```

- Setup projects directory

  ```
  copy .env.example and rename it as .env
  ---
  cp .env.example .env

  open up .env file and change the project path (must be in linux path format)
  ---
  PROJECTS_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/my_working_project/projects
  ```

- Run Web Server using docker-compose.yml

  ```
  docker compose up -d
  ```

- Stop Web Server using docker-compose.yml

  ```
  docker compose stop
  ```

- Remove/Delete Web Server using docker-compose.yml (optional)

- How to run **php83** console script from outside container

  ```
  check php modules
  - docker compose exec php83 sh -c "php -m"

  yii2 console
  - docker compose exec php83 sh -c "cd your_yii2_project && php yii some/controller-script"

  composer (check up version)
  - docker compose run --rm composer_php8 sh -c "cd your_yii2_project && composer --version"

  install project with composer
  - docker compose run --rm composer_php8 sh -c "composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic your_yii2_project"
  ```

- After Install some project try to access it with this url
  ```
  http://localhost/your_yii2_project/web
  http://localhost/your_laravel_project/web
  ```
